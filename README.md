To run

Input will be number of frames

Page stream is fixed in the code

COMPILE USING THIS COMMAND
g++ --std=c++17 clock.cpp ws.cpp wsclock.cpp main.cpp -o a.out

then run as ./a.out
Code will prompt to enter user wants to run in 'single policy mode' or 'all policies mode' ..
then we need to enter number of frames
Curently page seq of lenth 100 is hardcoded in code but we can take input as well from user
In "all policies" mode "graph will be plotted" to compare all algorithms in terms of hit rate
